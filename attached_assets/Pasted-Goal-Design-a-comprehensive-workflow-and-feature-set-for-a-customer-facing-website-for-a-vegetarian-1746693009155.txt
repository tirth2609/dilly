11. Payment System (Simulated):

Objective: Mimic payment workflows during development without real transactions. All displayed prices will be in INR.
Simulated Options:
Pay at Counter (Dine-in): Upon order placement (via QR code menu), a screen shows the order summary, table number, and instructions to pay at the counter after dining.
Cash on Delivery (Takeaway - if applicable): Option to pay the delivery driver upon arrival.
Pay on Pickup (Takeaway): Customers selecting this option will have their order marked as pending payment until payment is received at the restaurant.
UPI Scan (QR code displayed - Optional): At checkout, a static UPI QR code can be displayed. The user manually confirms payment by clicking "I've Paid" (no automatic verification).
Important Note: No integration with third-party payment gateways (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.) is required at this stage. All transactions are considered manual or mock.
